# next-js-flask
This project is built using a Flask backend and React frontend. Which shows the data on the frontend by setting up a Python backend API that returns the data.
Flask is a Python-based web framework for building web apps.
This application connects the frontend and backend. We will use our frontend to fetch our backend route. the data from the backend will be grabbed and displayed on the frontend.
To spin up this project you would need an activated virtual environment, download backend dependencies such as flask  and CORS. Make sure to also use npx-create-react-app .
